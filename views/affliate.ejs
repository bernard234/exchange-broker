<blockquote>Every deposit of your referral will bring you a reward in the amount of 7% and $2 for Referral Registration.</blockquote>
<p>Affiliate commission is accrued automatically after addition of deposit. You can use this amount at your discretion - to withdraw it or use it for new deposit. To become an affiliate and start earning money, you don't even need to have your own active deposit. However, we remind you that the best evidence of successful investing is always a personal experience.</p>
